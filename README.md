# AG News Text Classification
This is a mini project. In this project I build a text classification model using the AG News Data Set. The goal was to compare two models Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes and to see which one performs better.
The project is based on concepts I learned from the course Machine Learning by deeplearning.ai.
## Results
- Logistic Regression: 0.90
- Naive Bayes: 0.89
